generator will generator a sudoku save it in a new file
then it will call the solver with that file name and and solve the sudoku
and also save the solved sudoku in a new file


create a 9*9 grid inside a 2*2 grid with html css

then for the hints button give a hint but when hints == 0 hide the hint 
button by adding the hiddent class in css with js

player can do two things with the interface they can either play the sudoku
solver or get there own sudoku solved

the solved and whatever sudoku is needed in the main js program can be
taken from the files that it has been saved in

what we can do is that set class name of all
as index nuumber then set value accordingly by
the array you get from reading the file


on hint generate two random digits between 1 and 9 and then fill that 
index by searching for that index in the 2d array

document.querySelector(`.guess[${i}][${j}]`).value = '';
number = document.querySelector(`.guess[${i}][${j}]`).value;

use this above method to see whats in the inputs and then save all 
values to a 2d array and then save it into a file then read that
run the loop again and set the values and change background color 
to green
